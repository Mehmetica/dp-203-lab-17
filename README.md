# Real-Time Order Processing with Azure Stream Analytics

This project is based on Lab 17 from the DP-203: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure course. It demonstrates how to capture, process, and store streaming sales order data using various Azure services.

## üöÄ Overview

The solution uses the following Azure components:

- **Azure Event Hubs** ‚Äì for ingesting streaming data
- **Azure Stream Analytics** ‚Äì to process and aggregate streaming data
- **Azure Blob Storage** ‚Äì to store the processed output in JSON format

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Execution

### 1. Resource Provisioning
Resources were provisioned using:
- Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell)
- An ARM template and a PowerShell script

### 2. Data Simulation
A Node.js client app sent 1000 simulated sales orders (ProductID, Quantity) to Event Hubs.

### 3. Stream Processing
An Azure Stream Analytics job was created to:
- Read from Event Hubs
- Aggregate order quantities in 10-second tumbling windows
- Output results to Azure Blob Storage in JSON format

### 4. Query Used

```sql
SELECT
    DateAdd(second,-10,System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,
    System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,
    ProductID,
    SUM(Quantity) AS Orders
INTO
    [blobstore]
FROM
    [orders] TIMESTAMP BY EventProcessedUtcTime
GROUP BY ProductID, TumblingWindow(second, 10)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
